# DNA-NGS-scan

## Introduction

DNAscan is a fast and efficient bioinformatics pipeline that allows for the analysis of DNA Next Generation sequencing data, requiring very little computational effort and memory usage. DNAscan can analyse raw whole genome NGS data in ~8 hours, using as little as 4 cpus and ~4 Gbs of RAM while guaranteeing a very high performance. We do this by exploiting state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools. DNAscan can screen your DNA NGS data for single nucleotide variants, small indels, structural variants, repeat expansions, viral (or any other organismâ€™s) genetic material. Its results are annotated using a wide range of databases including ClinVar, EXAC, dbSNP and CADD and uploaded onto the gene.iobio platform for an on-the-fly analysis/interpretation.

Figure 1. Central panel: Pipeline overview. DNAscan accepts sequencing data, and optionally variant files. The pipeline firstly perform an alignment step (details in the left panel), followed by a customizable data analysis protocol (details in the right panel). Finally, results are annotated and a user friendly report is generated. Right panel: detailed description of the post alignment analysis pipeline (intensive mode). Aligned reads are used by the variant calling pipeline (Freebayes + GATK HC + Bcftools), both aligned and unaligned reads are used by Manta and ExpensionHunter (for which know repeat description files have to be provided)  to look for structural variants. The unaligned reads are mapped to a database of known viral genomes (NCBI database) to screen for the presence of their genetic material in the input sequencing data. Left panel: Alignment stage description. Raw reads are aligned with HISAT2. Resulting soft/hard-clipped reads and unaligned reads are realigned with BWA mem and then merged with the others using samtools.

## Documentation

### Minimum requierements

- Ubuntu >= 14.04
- 4.2 Gb of RAM

### Obtaining

**Version:** 1.0

Please make sure all dependencies are installed before running DNAscan. Instrutions about how to install all dependencies are available in the following chapter. However a bash script to set up all dependencies is available in scripts.

To download DNAscan please use git to download the most recent development tree:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snewhouse/DNA-NGS_scan.git
```

Once you have downloaded DNAscan, you can set up all available dependencies running the install_dependencies.sh script available in DNA-NGS_scan/scripts. This script will install all softaware dependencies as well as hg19 reference genome and its hisat2 and bwa indexes (these jobs runs in background and will finish after the scripts ends) as well as update paths.py:

```bash

bash /path/to/DNAscan/scripts/install_dependencies.sh /path/to/set_up/directory

source ~/.bashrc

```

You can easly set up your running deployment od DNAscan using docker. For instructutions about how to install docker see following sections.

After installing docker run an Ubuntu image:


```bash

docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash

```

Then install git and download this repository and run the install_dependencies.sh script:

```bash

apt-get update

apt-get install git

git clone https://github.com/snewhouse/DNA-NGS_scan.git

cd DNA-NGS_scan

bash /path/to/DNAscan/scripts/install_dependencies.sh /path/to/set_up/directory

source ~/.bashrc

```

### Docker/Singularity 

**Docker** is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers. Using containers to deploy our system and creating our analysis environment would allow us to make our work independent by the machine we work on. This would improve the reproducibility of our science, the portability and reliability of our deployments and avoid any machine specific issues. For this reason working using containers isn't just recommended but also makes things easier. Since docker is widely used and maintained we recommend it as container technology to use if possible. Unfortunately Docker does require sudo privileges to run its containers making its use difficult on HPC facilities.

**Singularity** is also a container project similar to Docker and does not require sudo privileges to run. This can be very important if you decide to use our framework on a machine for which you do not have such privileges. E.g. your institution HPC cluster. In this case you create your docker deployment locally and then converting the docker image into a singularoty image using this [script](https://github.com/KHP-Informatics/MNDA-DataManagement-System/tree/master/docker2singularity)

```bash 
$ ./docker2singularity.sh  [-m \"/mount_point1 /mount_point2\"] docker_image_name
```
### How to download the reference genome

#### hg38

```bash 
mkdir /path/to/wherever/hg38

cd /path/to/wherever/hg38

wget http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.fa.gz

gzip -d hg38.fa.gz

samtools faidx hg38.fa
```

#### hg19
```bash 
mkdir /path/to/wherever/hg19

cd /path/to/wherever/hg19

wget http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/chromFa.tar.gz

tar -zxvf chromFa.tar.gz

rm chr*

samtools faidx hg19.fa
```
### How to download the NCBI microbes DBs

#### Virus

Copy and paste in your command line the following commands to download the whole NCBI database of complete viral genome

```bash 
mkdir /path/to/wherever/virus_db

cd /path/to/wherever/virus_db

wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/viral/viral.1.1.genomic.fna.gz

wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/viral/viral.2.1.genomic.fna.gz

gzip -d viral.1.1.genomic.fna.gz

gzip -d viral.2.1.genomic.fna.gz

cat viral.1.1.genomic.fna >> virus_db.fa

cat viral.2.1.genomic.fna >> virus_db.fa

rm viral.1.1.genomic.fna viral.2.1.genomic.fna 
```


#### Bacteria

Copy and paste in your command line the following commands to download the whole NCBI database of complete bacterial genome (this might take a long time)

```bash 
mkdir /path/to/wherever/bacteria_db

cd /path/to/wherever/bacteria_db

wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/bacteria/bacteria.*.1.genomic.fna.gz

for i in $(ls | grep -e genomic.fna.gz -e bacteria); do gzip -d $i ; rm $i ; done 

for i in $(ls | grep -e genomic.fna -e bacteria); do cat $i >> bacteria_db.fa ; rm $i ; done  
```

#### Fungi

Copy and paste in your command line the following commands to download the whole NCBI database of complete bacterial genome (this might take a long time)

```bash 
mkdir /path/to/wherever/fungi_db

cd /path/to/wherever/fungi_db

wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/bacteria/fungi.*.1.genomic.fna.gz

for i in $(ls | grep -e genomic.fna.gz -e fungi); do gzip -d $i ; done 

for i in $(ls | grep -e genomic.fna -e fungi); do cat $i >> fungi_db.fa ; rm $i ; done  
```

### How to index the reference genome (or a microbes DB)

#### HISAT2
```bash
./path/to/hisat/hisat2-build /path/to/reference/file/reference_genome.fa index_base
```
E.g. If the reference genome is the file hg19.fa, located in /home/dataset/ and the hisat2-build binary is located in /home/bin/, the command line would be: 

```bash
./home/bin/hisat2-build /home/dataset/hg19.fa hg19
```



#### BWA 
```bash
./path/to/bwa/bwa index /path/to/reference/file/reference_genome.fa
```

E.g. If the reference genome is the file hg19.fa, located in /home/dataset/ and the bwa binary is located in /home/bin/, the command line would be: 

```bash
./home/bin/bwa index /home/dataset/hg19.fa
```

#### How to install dependencies

##### Using Bioconda

For a fast and easy deployment of most dependencies we recomend the use of the Miniconda2 package.
To download and install the latest Miniconda2 package, which contains the conda package manager:

```bash
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p /path/to/Miniconda2/installation/directory
```

In the file /path_to_your_home_dir/.bashrc add the following line:

```bash
export PATH=/path/to/Miniconda2/installation/directory/Miniconda2/bin:$PATH 
```
Bioconda is a repository of binary bioinformatics tools which makes it very easy to install many open source software. 
To install the needed dependencies with Bioconda:

```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels r
conda config --add channels bioconda
```

And then, if you want to install samtools for example:

```bash
conda install samtools
```
